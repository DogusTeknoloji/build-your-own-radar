Lightweight Architecture Decision Records,kullan,teknikler,FALSE,"Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of <a href=""/radar/teknikler/evolutionary-architecture"">evolutionary architecture</a>, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. <strong>Lightweight Architecture Decision Records</strong> is a <a href=""http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions"">technique</a> for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We recommend <a href=""http://github.com/npryce/adr-araçlar"">storing these details in source control</a>, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself. For most projects, we see no reason why you wouldn't want to use this technique.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Applying product management to internal platformlar,deneyimle,teknikler,FALSE,We've seen a steep increase in interest in the topic of digital platformlar over the past 12 months. Companies looking to roll out new digital solutions quickly and efficiently are building internal platformlar, which offer teams self-service access to the business APIs, araçlar, knowledge and support necessary to build and operate their own solutions. We find that these platformlar are most effective when they're given the same respect as an external product offering. <strong>Applying product management to internal platformlar</strong> means establishing empathy with internal consumers (read: developers) and collaborating with them on the design. Platform product managers establish roadmaps and ensure the platform delivers value to the business and enhances the developer experience. Some owners even create a brand identity for the internal platform and use that to market the benefits to their colleagues. Platform product managers look after the quality of the platform, gather usage metrics, and continuously improve it over time. Treating the platform as a product helps to create a thriving ecosystem and avoids the pitfall of building yet another stagnant, underutilized service-oriented architecture.,,,,,,,,,
Architectural fitness function,deneyimle,teknikler,FALSE,"Borrowed from evolutionary computing, a fitness function is used to summarize how close a given design solution is to achieving the set aims. When defining an evolutionary algorithm, the designer seeks a ‘better’ algorithm, the fitness function defines what ‘better’ means in this context. An <strong>architectural fitness function</strong>, as defined in <a href=""http://www.thoughtworks.com/books/building-evolutionary-architectures"">Building Evolutionary Architectures</a>, provides an objective integrity değerlendirment of some architectural characteristics, which may encompass existing verification criteria, such as unit testing, metrics, monitors, and so on. We believe architects can communicate, validate and preserve architectural characteristics in an automated, continual manner, which is the key to building evolutionary architectures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Autonomous bubble pattern,deneyimle,teknikler,FALSE,"Many organizations we work with are trying hard to use modern engineering approaches to build new capabilities and features, while also having to coexist with a long tail of legacy systems. An old strategy that, based on our experience, has turned out to be increasingly helpful in these scenarios is <a href=""http://dddcommunity.org/strategic-design/"">Eric Evans's</a> <strong>Autonomous bubble pattern</strong>. This approach involves creating a fresh context for new application development that is shielded from the entanglements of the legacy world. This is a step beyond just using an <a href=""http://wiki.c2.com/?AnticorruptionLayer"">anticorruption layer</a>. It gives the new bubble context full control over its backing data, which is then asynchronously kept up-to-date with the legacy systems. It requires some work to protect the boundaries of the bubble and keep both worlds consistent, but the resulting autonomy and reduction in development friction is a first bold step toward a modernized future architecture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chaos Engineering,deneyimle,teknikler,FALSE,"In previous editions of the Radar, we've talked about using <a href=""/radar/araçlar/chaos-monkey"">Chaos Monkey</a> from Netflix to test how a running system is able to cope with outages in production by randomly disabling instances and measuring the results. <strong>Chaos Engineering</strong> is the nascent term for the wider application of this technique. By running experiments on distributed systems in production, we're able to build confidence that those systems work as expected under turbulent conditions. A good place to start understanding this technique is the <a href=""http://principlesofchaos.org/"">Principles of Chaos Engineering</a> website.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Domain-scoped events,deneyimle,teknikler,TRUE,"In previous editions of the Radar, we've talked about using <a href=""/radar/araçlar/chaos-monkey"">Chaos Monkey</a> from Netflix to test how a running system is able to cope with outages in production by randomly disabling instances and measuring the results. <strong>Chaos Engineering</strong> is the nascent term for the wider application of this technique.

Hosted identity management as a service,deneyimle,teknikler,TRUE,"Identity management is a critical platform component. External users on mobile apps need to be authenticated, developers need to be given access to delivery infrastructure components, and microservices may need to identify themselves to other microservices. You should ask yourself whether identity management should be “self-hosted”. In our experience, a <strong>hosted identity management as a service</strong> (SaaS) solution is preferable. We believe that top-tier hosted providers such as <a href=""/radar/platformlar/auth0"">Auth0</a> and <a href=""http://www.okta.com/"">Okta</a> can provide better uptime and security SLAs. That said, sometimes self-hosting the solution is a realistic decision, especially for enterprises that have the operational discipline and resources to do so safely. Large enterprise identity solutions typically offer a much more expansive range of capabilities such as centralized entitlements, governance reporting and separation of duties management among others. However, these concerns are typically more relevant for employee identities, especially in regulated enterprises with legacy systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Micro frontends,deneyimle,teknikler,FALSE,"We've seen significant benefits from introducing <a href=""/radar/teknikler/microservices"">microservices</a> architectures, which have allowed teams to scale the delivery of independently deployed and maintained services. Unfortunately, we've also seen many teams create front-end monoliths — a single, large and sprawling browser application — on top of their back-end services. Our preferred (and proven) approach is to split the browser-based code into <strong>micro frontends</strong>. In this approach, the web application is broken down into its features, and each feature is owned, frontend to backend, by a different team. This ensures that every feature is developed, tested and deployed independently from other features. Multiple teknikler exist to recombine the features — sometimes as pages, sometimes as components — into a cohesive user experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pipelines for infrastructure as code,deneyimle,teknikler,FALSE,The use of continuous delivery pipelines to orchestrate the release process for software has become a mainstream concept. However, automatically testing changes to infrastructure code isn’t as widely understood. Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) araçlar can be used to test server configuration (e.g., Chef cookbooks, Puppet modules, Ansible playbooks), server image building (e.g., Packer), environment provisioning (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) and integration of environments. The use of <strong>pipelines for infrastructure as code</strong> enables errors to be found before changes are applied to operational environments — including environments used for development and testing. They also offer a way to ensure that infrastructure tooling is run consistently, from CI/CD agents, as opposed to being run from individual workstations. Some challenges remain, however, such as the longer feedback loops associated with standing up containers and virtual machines. Still, we've found this to be a valuable technique.,
Polycloud,deneyimle,teknikler,FALSE,"Organizations are becoming more comfortable with the <strong>Polycloud</strong> strategy — rather than going ""all-in"" with one provider, they are passing different types of workloads to different providers based on their own strategy. Some of them apply the best-of-breed approach, for example: putting standard services on AWS, but using Google for machine learning and data-oriented applications and Azure for Microsoft Windows applications. For some organizations this is a cultural and business decision. Retail businesses, for example, often refuse to store their data on Amazon and they distribute load to different providers based on their data. This is different to a cloud-agnostic strategy of aiming for portability across providers, which is costly and forces lowest-common-denominator thinking. Polycloud instead focuses on using the best match that each cloud provider offers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Embedded mobile mocks,değerlendir,teknikler,TRUE,When developing mobile applications, our teams often find themselves without an external server for testing apps. Setting up an over-the-wire mock may be a good fit for this particular problem. Developing the HTTP mocks and compiling them into the mobile binary for testing — <strong>embedded mobile mocks</strong> — enables teams to test their mobile apps when disconnected and with no external dependencies. This technique may require creating an opinionated library based on both the networking library used by the mobile app and your usage of the underlying library.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ethereum for decentralized applications,değerlendir,teknikler,FALSE,"Blockchains have been widely hyped as the panacea for all things fintech, from banking to digital currency to supply chain transparency. We’ve previously featured <a href=""/radar/platformlar/ethereum"">Ethereum</a> because of its feature set, which includes smart contracts. Now, we're seeing more development using <strong>Ethereum for decentralized applications</strong> in <a href=""http://www.stateofthedapps.com/"">other areas</a>. Although this is still a very young technology, we're encouraged to see it being used to build decentralized applications beyond cryptocurrency and banking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Event streaming as the source of truth,değerlendir,teknikler,FALSE,"As event streaming platformlar, such as <a href=""/radar/araçlar/apache-kafka"">Apache Kafka</a>, rise in popularity, many consider them as an advanced form of message queuing, used solely to transmit events. Even when used in this way, event streaming has its benefits over traditional message queuing. However, we're more interested in how people use <strong>event streaming as the source of truth</strong> with platformlar (Kafka in particular) as the primary store for data as immutable events. A service with an <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html"">Event Sourcing</a> design, for example, can use Kafka as its event store, those events are then available for other services to consume. This technique has the potential to reduce duplicating efforts between local persistence and integration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GraphQL for server side resource aggregation,değerlendir,teknikler,TRUE,"One pattern that comes up again and again when building microservice-style architectures is how to handle the aggregation of many resources server-side. In recent years, we've seen the emergence of a number of patterns such as <a href=""/radar/teknikler/bff-backend-for-frontends"">Backend for Frontend (BFF)</a> and araçlar such as <a href=""http://netflix.github.io/falcor/"">Falcor</a> to address this. Our teams have started using <strong>GraphQL for server-side resource aggregation</strong> instead. This differs from the usual mode of using <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/graphql"">GraphQL</a> where clients directly query a GraphQL server. When using this technique, the services continue to expose RESTful APIs but under-the-hood aggregate services use GraphQL resolvers as the implementation for stitching resources from other services. This technique simplifies the internal implementation of aggregate services or BFFs by using GraphQL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Log level per request,değerlendir,teknikler,TRUE,"One problem with observability in a highly distributed microservices architecture is the choice between logging everything — and taking up huge amounts of storage space — or randomly sampling logs and potentially missing important events. Recently, we’ve noticed a technique that offers a compromise between these two solutions. Set the <strong>log level per request</strong> via a parameter passed in through the tracing header. Using a tracing framework, possibly based on the <a href=""/radar/platformlar/opentracing"">OpenTracing</a> standard, you can pass a correlation id from service to service in a single transaction. You can even inject other data, such as the desired log level, at the initiating transaction and pass it along with the tracing information. This ensures that the additional data collected corresponds to a single user transaction as it flows through the system. This is also a useful technique for debugging, since services might be paused or otherwise modified on a transaction-by-transaction basis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Service mesh,değerlendir,teknikler,FALSE,"As large organizations transition to more autonomous teams owning and operating their own microservices, how can they ensure the necessary consistency and compatibility between those services without relying on a centralized hosting infrastructure? To work together efficiently, even autonomous microservices need to align with some organizational standards. A <strong>service mesh</strong> offers consistent discovery, security, tracing, monitoring and failure handling without the need for a shared asset such as an API gateway or ESB. A typical implementation involves lightweight reverse-proxy processes deployed alongside each service process, perhaps in a separate container. These proxies communicate with service registries, identity providers, log aggregators, and so on. Service interoperability and observability are gained through a shared implementation of this proxy but not a shared runtime instance. We've advocated for a decentralized approach to microservice management for some time and are happy to see this consistent pattern emerge. Open source projects such as <a href=""http://linkerd.io/"">linkerd</a> and <a href=""http://istio.io/"">Istio</a> will continue to mature and make service meshes even easier to implement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sidecars for endpoint security,değerlendir,teknikler,FALSE,"Microservices architecture, with a large number of services exposing their assets and capabilities through APIs and an increased attack surface, demand a zero trust security architecture — ‘never trust, always verify’. However, enforcing security controls for communication between services is often neglected, due to increased service code complexity and lack of libraries and language support in a polyglot environment. To get around this complexity, some teams delegate security to an out-of-process sidecar — a process or a container that is deployed and scheduled with each service sharing the same execution context, host and identity. Sidecars implement security capabilities, such as transparent encryption of the communication and TLS (Transport Layer Security) termination, as well as authentication and authorization of the calling service or the end user. We recommend you look into using <a href=""http://istio.io/"">Istio</a>, <a href=""http://linkerd.io/"">linkerd</a> or <a href=""http://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy"">Envoy</a> before implementing your own <strong>sidecars for endpoint security</strong>.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Generic cloud usage,kaçın,teknikler,TRUE,"The major cloud providers continue to add new features to their clouds at a rapid pace, and under the banner of <a href=""/radar/teknikler/polycloud"">Polycloud</a> we've suggested using multiple clouds in parallel, to mix and match services based on the strengths of each provider’s offerings. Increasingly, we're seeing organizations prepare to use multiple clouds — not to benefit from individual provider’s strengths, though, but to avoid vendor ""lock-in"" at all costs. This, of course, leads to <strong>generic cloud usage</strong>, only using features that are present across all providers, which reminds us of the lowest common denominator scenario we saw 10 years ago when companies avoided many advanced features in relational databases in an effort to remain vendor neutral. The problem of lock-in is real. However, instead of treating it with a sledgehammer approach, we recommend looking at this problem from the perspective of exit costs and relate those to the benefits of using cloud-specific features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recreating ESB antipatterns with Kafka,kaçın,teknikler,FALSE,"Kafka is becoming very popular as a messaging solution, and along with it, <a href=""/radar/platformlar/kafka-streams"">Kafka Streams</a> is at the forefront of the wave of interest in streaming architectures. Unfortunately, as they start to embed Kafka at the heart of their data and application platformlar, we're seeing some organizations <strong>recreating ESB antipatterns with Kafka</strong> by centralizing the Kafka ecosystem components — such as connectors and stream processors — instead of allowing these components to live with product or service teams. This reminds us of seriously problematic ESB antipatterns, where more and more logic, orchestration and transformation were thrust into a centrally managed ESB, creating a significant dependency on a centralized team. We're calling this out to dissuade further implementations of this flawed pattern.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Appium Test Distribution,deneyimle,araçlar,TRUE,"We've featured <a href=""/radar/araçlar/appium"">Appium</a> in the Radar in the past. It's one of the most popular mobile test automation frameworks. As we scale our test suite, being able to run our tests in parallel against an array of devices is key in having short feedback loops. <a href=""http://github.com/saikrishna321/AppiumTestDistribution""><strong>Appium Test Distribution</strong></a> solves this problem very effectively with its ability to run tests in parallel as well as run the same tests on multiple devices. Among other things, it distinguishes itself by its ability to add and remove devices in which tests run without any manual setup required and with its ability to run tests on remote devices. We've used it in a few projects at ThoughtWorks over the last couple of years and it worked very well for us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BackstopJS,deneyimle,araçlar,TRUE,"We've been enjoying <strong><a href=""http://github.com/garris/BackstopJS"">BackstopJS</a></strong> for visual regression testing of web applications. The configurable viewports and ability to adjust tolerances are particularly useful, as is the visual comparison tool, which makes it easier to spot minor variations. It has good scriptability and the option to run in <a href=""/radar/araçlar/headless-chrome-for-front-end-test"">Headless Chrome</a>, PhantomJS and SlimerJS. We find it particularly helpful when running it against <a href=""/radar/teknikler/living-css-style-guides"">living component style guides</a>.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Headless Chrome for front-end test,deneyimle,araçlar,FALSE,"Since mid-2017, Chrome users have had the option of running the browser in headless mode. This feature is ideally suited to running front-end browser tests without the overhead of displaying actions on a screen. Previously, this was largely the province of PhantomJS but <a href=""http://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/06/headless-karma-mocha-chai"">Headless Chrome</a> is rapidly replacing the JavaScript-driven WebKit approach. Tests in Headless Chrome should run much faster, and behave more like a real browser, but our teams have found that it does use more memory than PhantomJS. With all these advantages, <strong>Headless Chrome for front-end test</strong> is likely to become the de facto standard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Helm,deneyimle,araçlar,TRUE,"<a href=""http://helm.sh""><strong>Helm</strong></a> is a package manager for <a href=""/radar/platformlar/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a>. The set of Kubernetes resources that together define an application is packaged as charts. These charts can describe a single resource, such as a Redis pod, or a full stack of a web application: HTTP servers, databases and caches. Helm, by default, comes with a repository of curated Kubernetes applications that are maintained in the official <a href=""http://github.com/kubernetes/charts"">charts repository</a>. It’s also easy to set up a private chart repository for internal usage. Helm has two components: a command line utility called Helm and a cluster component called Tiller. Securing a Kubernetes cluster is a wide and nuanced topic, but we highly recommend setting up Tiller in a role-based access control (RBAC) environment. We’ve used Helm in a number of client projects and it’s dependency management, templating and hook mechanism has greatly simplified the application lifecycle management in Kubernetes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jupyter,deneyimle,araçlar,FALSE,"Over the last couple of years, we've noticed a steady rise in the popularity of analytics notebooks. These are Mathematica-inspired applications that combine text, visualization and code in a living, computational document. Increased interest in machine learning — along with the emergence of Python as the programming language of choice for practitioners in this field — has focused particular attention on Python notebooks, of which <a href=""http://jupyter.org/""><strong>Jupyter</strong></a> seems to be gaining the most traction among ThoughtWorks teams.

Google Kubernetes Engine (<strong>GKE</strong>) is a managed Kubernetes solution for deploying containerized applications that alleviates the operational overhead of running and maintaining Kubernetes clusters. Our teams have had a good experience using GKE, with the platform doing the heavy lifting of applying security patches, monitoring and auto-repairing the nodes, and managing multicluster and multiregion networking. In our experience, Google's API-first approach in exposing platform capabilities, as well as using industry standards such as <a href=""/radar/platformlar/oauth"">OAuth</a> for service authorisation, improve the developer experience. It's important to consider that GKE is under rapid development with many of its APIs in beta release which, despite the developers' best efforts to abstract consumers from underlying changes, can impact you. We're expecting continuous improvement around maturity of <a href=""/radar/araçlar/infrastructure-as-code"">infrastructure as code</a> with <a href=""http://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/container_cluster.html"">Terraform on GKE</a> and similar araçlar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cloud Spanner,değerlendir,platformlar,FALSE,"<a href=""http://cloud.google.com/spanner/""><strong>Cloud Spanner</strong></a> is a fully managed relational database service offering high availability and strong consistency without compromising latency. Google has been working on a globally distributed database called Spanner for quite some time. It has recently released the service to the outside world as Cloud Spanner. You can scale your database instance from one to thousands of nodes across the globe without worrying about data consistency. By levering <a href=""http://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/true-time-external-consistency"">TrueTime</a>, a highly available and distributed clock, Cloud Spanner provides strong consistency for reads and snapshots. You can use standard SQL to read data from Cloud Spanner, but for write operations you have to use their RPC API. Although not all services would require a global-scale distributed database, the general availability of Cloud Spanner is a big shift in the way we think about databases.

TensorFlow Serving,değerlendir,platformlar,FALSE,"Machine-learning models are starting to creep into everyday business applications. When enough training data is available, these algorithms can address problems that might have previously required complex statistical models or heuristics. As we move from experimental use to production, we need a reliable way to host and deploy the models that can be accessed remotely and scale with the number of consumers. <a href=""http://www.tensorflow.org/serving/""><strong>TensorFlow Serving</strong></a> addresses part of that problem by exposing a remote gRPC interface to an exported model, this allows a trained model to be deployed in a variety of ways. TensorFlow Serving also accepts a stream of models to incorporate continuous training updates, and its authors maintain a Dockerfile to ease the deployment process. Presumably, the choice of gRPC is to be consistent with the TensorFlow execution model, however, we’re generally wary of protocols that require code generation and native bindings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TICK Stack,değerlendir,platformlar,TRUE,"<a href=""http://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/""><strong>TICK Stack</strong></a> is a platform composed of open source components which makes collection, storage, graphing and alerting on-time series data such as metrics and events easy. The components of the TICK Stack are: Telegraf, a server agent for collecting and reporting metrics, InfluxDB, a high-performance time series database, Chronograf, a user interface for the platform, and Kapacitor, a data-processing engine that can process, stream and batch data from InfluxDB. Unlike <a href=""/radar/araçlar/prometheus"">Prometheus</a>, which is based on the Pull model, the TICK Stack is based on the Push model of collecting data. The heart of the system is the InfluxDB component which is one of the best time series databases. This stack is backed by InfluxData and needs the enterprise version for features such as DB clustering, but it’s still a fairly good choice for monitoring.

Overambitious API gateways,kaçın,platformlar,FALSE,We remain concerned about business logic and process orchestration implemented in middleware, especially where it requires expert skills and tooling while creating single points of scaling and control. Vendors in the highly competitive API gateway market are continuing this trend by adding features through which they attempt to differentiate their products. This results in <strong>overambitious API gateway</strong> products whose functionality — on top of what is essentially a reverse proxy — encourages designs that continue to be difficult to test and deploy. API gateways do provide utility in dealing with some specific concerns — such as authentication and rate limiting — but any domain smarts should live in applications or services.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CSS Modules,deneyimle,diller & kütüphaneler,FALSE,"Most large CSS codebases require complex naming schemes to help avoid naming conflicts in the global namespace. <a href=""http://github.com/css-modules/css-modules""><strong>CSS Modules</strong></a> address these problems by creating a local scope for all class names in a single CSS file. This file is imported to a JavaScript module, where CSS classes are referenced as strings. Then, in the build pipeline (Webpack, Browserify, etc.), the class names are replaced with generated unique strings. This is a significant change in responsibilities. Previously, a human had to manage the global namespace, to avoid class naming conflicts, now that responsibility rests with the build tooling. A small downside we've encountered with CSS Modules: functional tests are usually out of the local scope and can therefore not reference classes by the name defined in the CSS file. We recommend using IDs or data attributes instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although quite new and immature compared to <a href=""/radar/platformlar/tensorflow"">Tensorflow</a>, programmers find PyTorch much easier to work with. Because of its object-orientation and native Python implementation, models can be expressed more clearly and succinctly and debugged during execution. Although many of these frameworks have emerged recently, PyTorch has the backing of Facebook and broad range of partner organisations, including NVIDIA, which should ensure continuing support for CUDA architectures.
